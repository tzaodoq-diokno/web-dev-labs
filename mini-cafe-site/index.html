        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Sip and Run Café was born from a runner’s search for more than just another coffee shop. 
        Tired of places that only served drinks, our founder wanted a space that combined strong brews, 
        fresh pastries, and running essentials like shoes, watches, and sunglasses. 
        It’s a café designed for those who chase miles and moments, one sip at a time.</p>
